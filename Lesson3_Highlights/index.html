            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records the changes to a file or a set of files over a period of time so that developers can recall back to a earlier version if needed. Developers do this for a variety of reasons such as compare changes over time, see what was modified that is now causing problems, and help keep track who caused an issue and when. Most developers use a distributed version control systems to not only keep track of the files but help distribute the project files to members of a group and to create back up client repositories that can be used to restore the server repository.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Linux kernel is an open source software project that was fairly large in scope. It required the use of BitKeeper to help keep everything maintained, updated, and archived relevant information until the year 2005. BitKeeper at this time changed their business model forcing the Linux development community to find a alternative version control. This led them to just build their own version control called Git. It was made with five goals in mind that it would fast, simple in design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel effecintly.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Takes Snapshots</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the reasons Git is a version control  system is because it takes a snapshot of all your files at the time of submitting a new version to the server repository. This is different to most version control systems because usually they only record the files that did change at the time of uploading to the server. Git on the other hand records changes at the time of uploading and any file that does not get changed will also be recorded. This helps make git more than a simple version control system and more like a mini fill system.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another factor that makes git a very powerful version control system is that nearly every operation can be performed on the developers own local repository rather than on the sever. A developer can go looking through the entire history of the project can in a moment and easily compare changes made at any point in time or even roll back some changes. This allows the developer to take his work virtually any where he needs to be whether that be at home or in the middle of nowhere for however long that will be. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main sates called commit, modified, and staged which are used for storing the developers files. The commit state is used for files that are stored in the developers local repository. The modified state is used for any file in the commit state that gets modified. The last state staged is used for any modified file that is now ready to be committed to the next developer snapshot. </p>
